# Plant Disease Classification - Group A

This is the repository for the Capstone Project for COMP 6721 - Applied AI.
The project is titled: Early Identification and Classification of Plant Disease Using CNN Models

#### Goal of the Project:

#### The selected Dataset that will be Used for this project are:

    1. Plant Village
    2. PlantDoc
    3. PlantaeK

#### CNN Models that will be used for implementation are:

    1. Pre-trained techniques using Transfer learning will trained on VGG16, AlexNet, and ResNet50.
    2. Training CNN Model from Scratch on VGG16, AlexNet, and ResNet50.
