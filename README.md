# Plant Disease Classification - Group A
This is the repository for the Capstone Project for COMP 6721 - Applied AI.
The project is titled: Early Identification and Classification of Plant Disease Using CNN Models

#### Goal of the Project:

 #### The selected Dataset that will be Used for this project are:
                                   1. Plant Village
                                   2. PlantDoc
                                   3. PlantaeK

#### CNN Models that will be used for implementation are:      
                  1. Pre-trained techniques using Transfer learning will trained on VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet.
                  2. Training model from scratch ..... will discover soon.
